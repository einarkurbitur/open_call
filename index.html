		<h1>What is the PS Action Club?</h1>
		<p class="header-text">Throughout history artists have been recording their hand and mind through their work. Pablo Picasso was filmed by Belgian director Paul Haesaerts while painting on glass in 1949. The glass painting registered the way the hand of the master produced
			his signature paintings.
			<br><br> Sol LeWitt created written set of instructions between 1969 and 2007. These instructions were never executed by LeWitt himself. This way every execution and interpretations of the written instructions will be different.
			<br><br> One year after LeWitt died and thereby ended his series of written instructions, another American artist named Cory Arcangel created a series of Photoshop Gradient works. The title of the Gradients was the Photoshop instruction that would execute
			the work.
			<br><br> The PS Action Club is a platform that collects Photoshop Action files. These files are a set of Photoshop instructions that can be run via this program. The action will one by one play out in front of your eyes. This way the hand of the artist
			is formed inside the Photoshop action.
