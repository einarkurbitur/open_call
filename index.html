		<h1>What is the PS Action Club?</h1>
		<p class="header-text">Throughout history, artists have been recording their hands and minds through their work. Pablo Picasso was filmed by Belgian director Paul Haesaerts while painting on glass in 1949. The film registered the way the hand of the artist produced his signature paintings. 
		<br><br>
		Sol LeWitt created written sets of instructions between 1969 and 2007. These instructions were almost never executed by LeWitt himself. This way every execution and interpretation of the written instructions would give a different outcome. 
		<br><br>
		One year after LeWitt died and thereby ended his series of written instructions, another American artist named Cory Arcangel created a series of Photoshop Gradient works. The titles of the work explained their features in Photoshop. 
		<br><br>
		The PS Action Club is a platform that collects and presents Photoshop action files as an artistic medium. These actions are a set of instructions that can only be run in Photoshop. The action will step by step recreate the act of the creation instead of focusing on the final work. This way the hand of the artist is formed inside the Photoshop action.
